## Models:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03764 - Neuro-GPT (EEGConformer + GPT3), pretrained on TUH, didn't have good results, probably because mental image classification data (EEGImageNet, Alljoined1) have very short EEG length (300 - 500 points)

## Datasets
https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07151 - EEG-IamgeNet dataset, biggest I have found for mental image classification.
